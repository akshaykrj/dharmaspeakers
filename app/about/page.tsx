              By curating and connecting speakers across domains, the Bureau
              helps bridge ancient wisdom with present-day contexts in a manner
              that is thoughtful, accessible, and responsible.

            <p className="text-[15px] md:text-base text-[#3A3A3A] leading-relaxed">
              Equally, the Bureau serves to support speakers themselves by
              providing structure and continuity to their public engagement. It
              reduces the burden of ad hoc outreach and coordination, allowing
              speakers to focus on study, reflection, and articulation, while
              ensuring their work reaches appropriate platforms and audiences.

            <p className="text-[15px] md:text-base text-[#3A3A3A] leading-relaxed">
              In doing so, the Dharma Speakers Bureau contributes to a
              sustainable ecosystem where Dharmic ideas are not only preserved,
              but actively and coherently expressed in the life of society
              today.

              By Dharma, we refer to the underlying principles that sustain
              order, meaning, and balance in individual life and collective
              existence. Dharma is a contextual and reflective framework that
              guides right action (kartavya), ethical discernment (viveka), and
              responsibility (rna) in changing circumstances.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[15px] md:text-base text-[#3A3A3A] leading-relaxed">
              Rooted in Sanatan thought, Dharma recognizes that truth must be
              lived and applied according to time, place, and role. In this
              sense, Dharma integrates inner orientation with outward conduct,
              connecting philosophy with practice, values with action, and
              personal integrity with social responsibility.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[15px] md:text-base text-[#3A3A3A] leading-relaxed">
              Whether applied to family life, professional work, leadership, or
              public life, Dharma serves as a compass for navigating moral
              complexity, resolving dilemmas (dharma-sankata), and acting in
              ways that uphold both individual growth and collective well-being.

              The principles of curation are central to the Bureau’s
              functioning. Speakers are curated with care, based on depth of
              understanding, authenticity of grounding, ethical conduct, and
              the ability to engage responsibly with diverse audiences.

              balance, and thoughtful dialogue.
